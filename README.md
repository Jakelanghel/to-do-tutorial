### What I learned
This was a great tutorial and I learned alot about using local storage, data attributes, css pseudo elements, creating custom id's dynamicly, css grid
and array methods that I havent used before like filter() and find().

### Continued development
I stared this tutorial because I was working on the todo app challenge from frontendmentor.io and realized that I needed a better understaing of how to 
create custom checkboxes with HTML and CSS. I plan on using everything that I learned in this tutorial to finish that challenge from front end mentor.
